# Features
One of the standout features of this application is its ability to continually improve over time. We've integrated a data collection mechanism that allows the app to gather new data from users. This feature ensures that our model can be retrained with the most current data, enhancing its predictive power and maintaining its relevance in a constantly changing educational environment. By continuously feeding the model with up-to-date information, we ensure that our predictions remain as accurate and relevant as possible.

# Technologies & Tools Used
- ReactJs for frontend
- Flask for Backend
- SQL for database

Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of how to integrate machine learning models into web applications and how to design systems that can learn and adapt over time. The ability to predict placement outcomes accurately can be a game-changer for students and institutions, enabling them to make more informed decisions and improve their strategies for career planning.
